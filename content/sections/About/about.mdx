I'm an Undergraduate student in my Senior year studying Computer Science at Texas Tech University. I will be graduating Spring of 2021 with a Bachelor's degree in
Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

My experience consists of a Web Development internship in Tokyo with <a className="hvr-underline-from-left" href="https://emurgo.io/" target="\_blank"> Emurgo</a>
, and a research project at the <a className="hvr-underline-from-left" href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/phas/apdl/" target="\_blank"> Advanced Particle Detector Laboratory</a>.

I love learning new things, and trying new techonologies. With the amount of resources available online, I taught myself web development and the first project I
wanted to do was a personal website. This website was built using <a className="hvr-underline-from-left" href="https://gatsby.js/" target="\_blank"> Gatsby</a>
and the next framework I want to learn for React is <a className="hvr-underline-from-left" href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>.
