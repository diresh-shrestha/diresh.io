My name is Diresh Shrestha. I'm a Senior studying
Computer Science at Texas Tech University. I will be graduating Spring of 2021 with a Bachelor's of Science in
Computer Science.

I spend my free time reading books, learning new things, and trying new techonologies.
I wanted to build my own personal website and blog,
and web applications on my spare time. Being self taught, it turned out to be one of the best learning experience and in the process I really
enjoyed using React. To learn building static websites, I tried the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> framework and built
this website in the process. My next project will be built using <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a> framework.
