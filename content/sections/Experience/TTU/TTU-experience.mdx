The APD lab is built for high-energy particle detector R&D and an assembly of over 5,000 silicon modules for the next generation of high-granularity calorimeters (so-called HGCAL) to be deployed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.

My work involved collecting data, pre-processing the data and building and training different types of Neural Networks including a Convolutional Neural Network.
