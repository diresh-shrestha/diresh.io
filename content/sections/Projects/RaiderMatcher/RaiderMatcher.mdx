description: "A discord bot for college students"
---

With the ongoing pandemic and classes moving mostly online, it was becoming very
difficult to interact with other students, especially when it came to forming teams
for projects. To solve this problem, i came up with an idea to create a Discord bot (since most students already used Discord)
that can make finding teams easier.
