OMMISSION Project aims to organize a community to engage with journalism and
celebrate the work of individuals in the field.
Through the medium of clothing, we aim to put garments in
conversation with media ecology; bringing awareness to media
literacy and the contemporary conditions of the digital landscape.

I worked as a Front-End Developer for the OMMISSION Project team and
built their website.
