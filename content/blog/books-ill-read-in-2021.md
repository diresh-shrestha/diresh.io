The above tweet is from my favorite Twitter account [Orange Book](https://twitter.com/orangebook_) and even though I am writing a blog post about reading books, I believe it's an important thought to keep in mind.

One of my resolutions this year is to read at least 25 books and to really solidify the plan and keep myself accountable, I decided to plan out all the books I am going to read. I made a list of books that have been sitting in my online library collecting digital dust, books that I recently discovered, and books that are yet to be released. They are divided into 5 categories which are Science Fiction, Nonfiction, Fiction, Self-help, and Philosophy with 5 books in each category for a wide range of topics and variety.

Also, recently I have been interested in learning philosophy and since Socrates never wrote anything down, I couldn't think of a better place to start than Plato and some of his essential works. Plato wrote a total of 27 treatises (that we know of), and I have listed 5 of them under the philosophy category that I would like to read this year. So, without further ado, here is the list of books I will be reading this year.

## Science Fiction

### Death's End by Cixin Liu

![Death's End](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1430330507l/25451264._SX2000_.jpg)

I started the year with Death's End, the third and final book in the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy by Cixin Liu.

**Official Synopsis**: Half a century after the Doomsday Battle, the uneasy balance of Dark Forest Deterrence keeps the Trisolaran invaders at bay. Earth enjoys unprecedented prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge. With human science advancing daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent.

Cheng Xin, an aerospace engineer from the early twenty-first century, awakens from hibernation in this new age. She brings with her knowledge of a long-forgotten program dating from the beginning of the Trisolar Crisis, and her very presence may upset the delicate balance between two worlds. Will humanity reach for the stars or die in its cradle?

### Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir

![Project Hail Mary](https://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780593135204)

Andy Weir's breakout novel The Martian was one of my favorite sci-fi novels I read in 2015. It was funny, innovative and the movie directed by Ridley Scott was a faithful adaptation. After The Martian, there were a lot of expectations for his next novel The Artemis which was set on the moon. It left a lot of fans disappointed due to a poorly written protagonist but personally I liked the overall story. However, I am going into this book with not too high expectations.

**Official Synopsis**: Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission--and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.

Except that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his name, let alone the nature of his assignment, or how to complete it.

All he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.

His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that's been cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into the depths of space, it's up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.

And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance.

### Remote Control by Nnedi Okarofor

![Remote Control](https://images.macmillan.com/folio-assets/macmillan_us_frontbookcovers_350W/9781250772800.jpg)

This is the first book by Nnedi Okarofor that I will be reading but she seems to have quite the reputation having won both the Nebula and Hugo Award. The book is set to be released on January 19 and I am excited to read what Okarofor has crafted in her new novel.

**Official Synopsis**: The day Fatima forgot her name, Death paid a visit. From here on in she would be known as Sankofa­­--a name that meant nothing to anyone but her, the only tie to her family and her past.

Her touch is death, and with a glance, a town can fall. And she walks--alone, except for her fox companion--searching for the object that came from the sky and gave itself to her when the meteors fell and when she was yet unchanged; searching for answers.

But is there a greater purpose for Sankofa, now that Death is her constant companion?

### Dune by Frank herbert

![Dune](https://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780593099322)

Dune is one of the most renowned sci-fi classic and I have yet to read it. I bought the paperback last year but I never found the time. The book is also being brought to the big screen by one of my favorite directors Denis Villeneuve who has directed other sci-fi films like Arrival and Bladerunner 2049, both of which I loved.

**Official Synopsis**: Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for...

When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream.

### To Sleep in a Sea of Stars by Christopher Paolini

![To Sleep in a Sea of Stars](https://i.imgur.com/8sPeKJj.jpg)

To Sleep in a Sea of Stars was the Goodreads Choice 2020 winner in Science Fiction, which made me add the book to my reading list this year.

**Official Synopsis**: Kira Navárez dreamed of life on new worlds. Now she's awakened a nightmare. During a routine survey mission on an uncolonized planet, Kira finds an alien relic. At first she's delighted, but elation turns to terror when the ancient dust around her begins to _move_.

As war erupts among the stars, Kira is launched into a galaxy-spanning odyssey of discovery and transformation. First contact isn't at all what she imagined, and events push her to the very limits of what it means to be human.

While Kira faces her own horrors, Earth and its colonies stand upon the brink of annihilation. Now, Kira might be humanity's greatest and final hope...

## Nonfiction

### The Code Breaker by Walter Isaacson

![The Code Breaker](https://i.imgur.com/47Vc3lC.jpg)

Walter Isaacson is one of my favorite authors when it comes to biographies. He is most known for his biographies on Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Leonardo Da Vinci, and the Innovators which detailed how collaborative forces brought about the digital revolution. I loved all of his books and I am excited to read this one too. The book is set to be released on March 9.

**Official Synopsis**: When Jennifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a paperback titled _The Double Helix_ on her bed. She put it aside, thinking it was one of those detective tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Saturday, she discovered she was right, in a way. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn’t become scientists, she decided she would.

Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book’s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned **​**a curiosity ​of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions.

The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code.

Should we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing depression? Hmmm…Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids?

After helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in 2020. Her story is a thrilling detective tale that involves the most profound wonders of nature, from the origins of life to the future of our species.

### A Promised Land by Barack Obama

![A Promised Land](https://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9781524763169_p0_v2_s1200x630.jpg)

Obama is a voracious reader himself and I am looking forward to reading his account on his eight-year presidency.

**Official Synopsis**: A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making, from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy.

In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency—a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil.

### Prepared: What Kids Need for a Fulfilled Life by Diane Tavenner

![Prepared](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41V0V8n36sL.jpg)

A few years ago, I was in a really bad spot mentally and emotionally and to remedy it, I read a few self-help and psychology books. What I learned from the whole experience was that most of my emotional and psychological problems can be traced back to how I was brought up during childhood. This hit close to home and I finally came to realize and accept that it wasn't my fault and in the process I was able to forgive myself and my parents. Ever since then, I have thought about how to raise and educate a child in a way that they're prepared for the big bad world out there in case I have kids myself.

**Official Synopsis**: Diane Tavenner, founder of Summit Public Schools, offers a blueprint for a better way to educate our children, based on the revolutionary lessons, insights and methodology she and her faculty developed over 15 years at their famously successful charter schools in California and Washington, which she is now introducing to public school systems across the country that Summitt is partnering with to transform education and better prepare our children to lead fulfilled and successful lives.

### Permanent Record by Edward Snowden

![Permanent Record](https://i.imgur.com/mykMf07.jpg)

Edward Snowden is a whistleblower who exposed the mass surveillance programs implemented by the US government specifically the NSA, that spied on citizens, and collected data unlawfully. Some consider him a hero, some call him a traitor and although I am in the former group, I believe that's beside the point and we should not be focusing on his character but instead on the actual information that he risked his life to leak. His only goal according to him, was to bring to light the unprecedented level of privacy-invading operations by the government agencies and make the general public aware. Fast forward to now, most people have seemed to forget or simply not care whether or not the government's spying on them or if their privacy is a matter of utmost importance in a free world.

**Official Synopsis**: In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.

Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, _Permanent Record_ is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online—a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet’s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, _Permanent Record_ is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.

### Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow by Yuval Noah Harari

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/98VRMuC.jpg)

Sapiens was one of the best books I read last year, and so it goes without saying that I am stoked to read Harari's next work, Homo Deus.

**Official Synopsis**: Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed _New York Times_ bestseller and international phenomenon _Sapiens_, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity’s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.

Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.

What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? _Homo Deus_ explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.

With the same insight and clarity that made _Sapiens_ an international hit and a _New York Times_ bestseller, Harari maps out our future.

## Fiction

### The Rosie Effect by Graeme Simsion

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/r3aNL4N.jpg)

The Rosie Effect is the second book in the Don Tillman series. The first book The Rosie Project was the first and only romance novel I have ever read, and the only reason I picked it up was because Bill Gates had recommended it in his blog. I ended up loving it and I have since read it multiple times. I could relate with Don Tillman struggling in his love life and trying to solve the problem the only way he knew how by embarking on a wife project through which he meets Rosie who is the complete opposite of him.

**Official Synopsis**: Don Tillman and Rosie Jarman are back. The Wife Project is complete, and Don and Rosie are happily married and living in New York. But they're about to face a new challenge because - surprise - Rosie is pregnant.

Don sets about learning the protocols of becoming a father, but his unusual research style gets him into trouble with the law. Fortunately his best friend Gene is on hand to offer advice: he's left Claudia and moved in with Don and Rosie.

As Don tries to schedule time for pregnancy research, getting Gene and Claudia to reconcile, servicing the industrial refrigeration unit that occupies half his apartment, helping Dave the Baseball Fan save his business, and staying on the right side of Lydia the social worker, he almost misses the biggest problem of all: he might lose Rosie when she needs him the most.

### The Rosie Result by Graeme Simsion

![enter image description here](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OYUErwpNL.jpg)

I have decided to complete the journey of Don and Rosie with the final book in the series this year.

**Official Synopsis**: Don and Rosie are back in Melbourne after a decade in New York, and they’re about to face their most important project.

Their son, Hudson, is having trouble at school: his teachers say he isn’t fitting in with the other kids. Meanwhile, Rosie is battling Judas at work, and Don is in hot water after the Genetics Lecture Outrage. The life-contentment graph, recently at its highest point, is curving downwards.

For Don Tillman, geneticist and World’s Best Problem-Solver, learning to be a good parent as well as a good partner will require the help of friends old and new.

It will mean letting Hudson make his way in the world, and grappling with awkward truths about his own identity.

And opening a cocktail bar.

Hilarious and thought-provoking, with a brilliant cast of characters and an ending that will have readers cheering for joy, _The Rosie Result_ is the triumphant final instalment of the internationally bestselling series that began with _The Rosie Project_.

### The Midnight Library by Matt Haig

![The Midnight Library](https://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9780525559481_p0_v4_s550x406.jpg)

Winnder of the Goodreads choice award 2020 in the fiction category, I am currently reading this simultaneously with Death's End.

**Official Synopsis**: Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?

In _The Midnight Library_, Matt Haig's enchanting new novel, Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.

### A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles

![A Gentleman in Moscow](https://i.imgur.com/kmfxptg.jpg)

Going into this book completely blind but I have heard good things about it.

**Official Synopsis**: A Gentleman in Moscow immerses us in another elegantly drawn era with the story of Count Alexander Rostov. When, in 1922, he is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, the count is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him a doorway into a much larger world of emotional discovery.

Brimming with humour, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavour to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.

### Blood of Elves by Andrzej Sapkowski

![Blood of Elves](https://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9780316438988_p0_v2_s550x406.jpg)

By this point, I assume a lot of people have already watched the Netflix adaptation of the Witcher novels. As a book reader myself, and having played the games, I was eagerly anticipating the series. The show had a lot of problems and I wouldn't necessarily call it a faithful adaptation either. I think majority of book readers are unhappy with the writing of the show but that's with most book adaptations. To be fair, the show was fun to watch. The first season was based on the two short story novels The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny. Blood of Elves is the first full length novel in the series and the second season is going to be based on it. Reading the book is probably going to ruin the show for me but that will not stop me.

**Official Synopsis**: For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf.

Geralt of Rivia, the cunning assassin known as The Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child. This child has the power to change the world - for good, or for evil.

As the threat of war hangs over the land and the child is hunted for her extraordinary powers, it will become Geralt's responsibility to protect them all - and the Witcher never accepts defeat.

The Witcher returns in this sequel to _The Last Wish_, as the inhabitants of his world become embroiled in a state of total war.

## Self-Help

### The Headspace Guide to Meditation & Mindfulness by Andi Puddicombe

![Meditation & Mindfulness](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41e26dV9YXL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

My introduction to meditation was through the headspace app founded by Andy Puddicombe himself. Since then, I have been practicing meditation semi-regularly and have felt the benefits.

**Official Synopsis**: Quiet the mind, feel less stressed and less tired, and achieve a new level of calm and fulfillment in just ten minutes a day.

Andy Puddicombe, a former Buddhist monk, the Voice of Headspace, and the UK's foremost mindfulness expert, is on a mission: to get people to take 10 minutes out of their day to sit in the here and now.

Like his readers and students, Andy began his own meditation practice as a normal, busy person with everyday concerns, and he has since designed a program of mindfulness and guided meditation that fits neatly into a jam-packed daily routine - proving that just 10 minutes a day can make a world of difference.

Accessible and portable, The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness offers simple but powerful meditation techniques that positively impact every area of physical and mental health: from productivity and focus, to stress and anxiety relief, sleep, weight-loss, personal relationships...the benefits are limitless. The result? More headspace, less stress. Andy brings this ancient practice into the modern world, tailor made for the most time starved among us.

### Atomic Habits by James Clear

![Atomic Habits](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-nXsSRfZL.jpg)

One of the most important things I have learned in recent years is that small consistent efforts and good habits over a period of time leads to profound change. We all want to become an overnight success but that's hardly the way it ever works. Most success stories we hear are the result of decades of consistent work. Success is built on top of good habits and practicing good habits is a tough thing to do especially when most of our habits don't serve us.

**Official Synopsis**: No matter your goals, _Atomic Habits_ offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.

### Inner Engineering: A Yogi's Guide to Joy by Sadhguru

![Inner Engineering](https://i.imgur.com/iVQGgDe.jpg)

I heard about Sadhguru from a friend in Japan and after hearing a few of his lectures, I thought he had a few good ideas worth listening and that's how this book ended up in my reading list.

**Official Synopsis**: The practice of hatha yoga, as we commonly know it, is but one of eight branches of the body of knowledge that is yoga. In fact, yoga is a sophisticated system of self-empowerment that is capable of harnessing and activating inner energies in such a way that your body and mind function at their optimal capacity. It is a means to create inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the architect of your own joy.

A yogi lives life in this expansive state, and in this transformative book Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening, from a boy with an unusual affinity for the natural world to a young daredevil who crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, where time stood still and he emerged radically changed. Today, as the founder of Isha, an organization devoted to humanitarian causes, he lights the path for millions. The term _guru,_ he notes, means “dispeller of darkness, someone who opens the door for you. . . . As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation means that nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you perceive and experience life.” The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging book offers readers time-tested tools that are fresh, alive, and radiantly new. _Inner Engineering_ presents a revolutionary way of thinking about our agency and our humanity and the opportunity to achieve nothing less than a life of joy.

### The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle

![The Power of Now](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41cbPheOxmL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

I have read a few self-help books by now and if I learn at least one good thing from this book, I will be happy with it.

**Official Synopsis**: Eckhart Tolle's message is simple: living in the now is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment. And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly "living in the now" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.

### The Way of the Superior Man

![The Way of the Superior Man](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uaApZ9oxL.jpg)

**Official Synopsis**: In _The Way of the Superior Man_, David Deida explores the most important issues in men's lives—from career and family to women and intimacy to love and spirituality and relationships—to offer a practical guidebook for living a masculine life of integrity, authenticity, and freedom. Join this bestselling author and internationally renowned expert on sexual spirituality for straightforward advice, empowering skills, body practices, and more to help you realize a life of fulfillment, immediately and without compromise.

## Philosophy

### The Death and Trial of Socrates (Euthypro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo)

![The Death and Trial of Socrates](https://i.imgur.com/MYtusUZ.jpg)

**Official Synopsis**: Socrates is one of the great figures of Western history and the founding father of its philosophical tradition. In the Dialogues, by his pupil and fellow philosopher Plato, a fascinating portrait emerges of a man who spurned material wealth and believed above all in learning and inquiry. Apology, Crito, and Phaedo recount Socrates’ trial on charges of corrupting the youth of Athens, his defiance of the court, and his last days in jail passed in discussion with friends. They form an excellent introduction to a courageous and captivating figure who paid with his life for the right to free thought.

### The Republic

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/jYjyugK.jpg)

**Official Synopsis**: Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, this classic text is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation, other questions are raised: what is goodness?; what is reality?; and what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as guardians of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by philosopher kings.

### Meno

![Meno](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yEgcJc00L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

**Official Synopsis**: **Meno** (/ˈmiːnoʊ/; Greek: Μένων, Menōn) is a Socratic dialogue by Plato. In it, Socrates tries to determine the definition of virtue, or rather _arete_, meaning virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work is written in the Socratic dialectical style, and depicts Meno as being reduced to confusion or aporia. In response to Meno's paradox (or the learner's paradox), however, Socrates introduces positive ideas: the immortality of the soul, the theory of knowledge as a recollection (_anamnesis_), which Socrates demonstrates by posing a mathematical puzzle to one of Meno's slaves, the method of hypothesis, and, in the final lines, the distinction between knowledge and true belief.

### The Symposium

![The Symposium](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520522475l/81779.jpg)

**Official Synopsis**: A fascinating discussion on sex, gender, and human instincts, as relevant today as ever.

In the course of a lively drinking party, a group of Athenian intellectuals exchange views on eros, or desire. From their conversation emerges a series of subtle reflections on gender roles, sex in society and the sublimation of basic human instincts. The discussion culminates in a radical challenge to conventional views by Plato's mentor, Socrates, who advocates transcendence through spiritual love. The Symposium is a deft interweaving of different viewpoints and ideas about the nature of love--as a response to beauty, a cosmic force, a motive for social action and as a means of ethical education.

### Gorgias

![Gorgias](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41sq-4jjLvL._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

**Official Synopsis**: Taking the form of a dialogue between Socrates, Gorgias, Polus and Callicles, GORGIAS debates perennial questions about the nature of government and those who aspire to public office.  
Are high moral standards essential or should we give our preference to the pragmatist who gets things done or negotiates successfully? Should individuals be motivated by a desire for personal power and prestige, or genuine concern for the moral betterment of the citizens?  
These questions go to the heart of Athenian democratic principles and are more relevant than ever in today's political climate.
