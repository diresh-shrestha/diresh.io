At the beginning of each year, I take part in the Goodreads challenge. You specify the number of books you want to read that year and you try to reach that goal. Last year, my goal was 50 books, which in hindsight I was just setting myself up for failure. I figured I could read 1 book a week and I would have 50 books by the end of the year. I ended the year with 25 books read, which is not bad. This year, I adjusted my expectations and set a goal for 20 books. I ended up reading 12 books this year, which seems like I did worse than last year, and in a way I did but most of the books I read this year were massive 500+ pages books. This year I am planning on sticking with 20 books again but I will try very hard to reach that goal. I also want to try something different. After every book I read, I will reflect upon it by writing about it. Stuff like what I liked about it, what I learned from it, etc.

Some books that I left out are Recursion by Blake Crouch which was a fantastic book, and Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-five. I would've liked to write about them too but I read those books so early in the year that I don't have much recollection of them. I only remember thinking they were great books. I wanted to round up this year by writing about some of the best books I read this year so here are my thoughts on some of them.

## Why We Sleep

[![Why We Sleep](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WOq1TRGdL.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=53crTGcvVf&rank=1)

I'm a big fan of sleep and I am not ashamed of it. In our society, we have somehow equated sleep with being lazy, and being sleepless or pulling an all-nighter is something to be proud of. Personally, when I get anything less than 8 hours of sleep my productivity the next day drops sharply. I can't think straight, control my emotions too well, or make good decisions. For the longest time, I believed there was something wrong with me. Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep put all my misconceptions about sleep to rest. Walker is a neuroscientist who does sleep research at UC Berkeley and is also the founder of the Center for Human Sleep Science. He's spent most of his life doing sleep research and he lays out his findings in this book and urges the readers to get more sleep. Here are some of the key takeaways from the book:

- The shorter you sleep, the shorter your lifespan. Sleeping less than 6 hours a night weakens your immune system, brain functioning, and physical performance.
- There is no such thing as sleep debt. You can't recover all the sleep you lost during the week by sleeping for longer periods during the weekend.
- Circadian rhythm is our internal biological clock that regulates our sleep-wake cycle and melatonin is a hormone that is released in response to darkness. People have different circadian rhythms meaning some people are morning types while others are evening types.
- Electricity and artificial light have made our society darkness deprived and the blue lights emitted from our electronic devices have delayed the release of melatonin causing us to sleep later and later at night.
- Adenosine is a chemical that affects sleepiness and caffeine blocks the receptors that adenosine affects.
- Sleep is essential for the formation of memory. NREM sleep helps in the reflection of events that happened during the day and REM sleep helps in integration to build an accurate model of the world.
- Biphasic sleeping patterns are more natural for humans. If you look at locations around the world where people live the longest and untouched hunter-gatherer tribes, they tend to sleep 7-9 hours during the night and take a 30 minute - hour nap during the afternoon.
- Humans are the only animals on Earth that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep.
- When it comes to Daylight Savings, in the Spring when we lose an hour of sleep there is a 24% increase in heart attacks the next day, and when we gain an hour in the Autumn, there is a 21% decrease in heart attacks. Even an hour of sleep is crucial.

So how can we get more sleep or better sleep? Walker outlines a few tips that could help you go to sleep earlier and have a more restful sleep:

1.  Stick to a sleep schedule. Consistency is key.
2.  Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. The tiredness you feel after a workout will help you fall asleep faster.
3.  Avoid caffeine and nicotine.
4.  Avoid alcoholic drinks.
5.  Avoid large meals and beverages at night.
6.  Don't take naps after 3 pm.
7.  Relax before bed. Reading a book, meditating, doing yoga, or listening to peaceful music will help you unwind.
8.  Take a hot bath before bed. The drop in body temperature after a hot bath can help you fall asleep.
9.  Dark, cool, and gadget-free bedroom. Make your room as dark as possible and keep it cool. Avoid using electronics 2 hours before bedtime.
10. Have the right sunlight exposure. Best to be exposed to the morning sunlight for about 30 minutes.
11. Don't lie in bed awake. Only use your bed for sleeping.

## The Three-Body Problem

[![The Three-Body Problem](https://i.imgur.com/66uTxPL.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=hbwaH2vAnH&rank=1)

The Three-Body Problem by Chinese science fiction author Cixin Liu and translated by Ken Liu is an amazing piece of hard science fiction. It also won one of the most prestigious awards in science fiction, the Hugo Award. The book is the first part of a trilogy called Remembrance of Earth's Past. It was also recommended by plenty of high-profile people such as Barack Obama and Mark Zuckerberg.

The book starts around the Cultural Revolution in China when one of the main characters Ye Wenjie, an astrophysicist, sees her father who is a physicist, beaten to death for not giving up his "western" science. She is then labeled as a traitor and is forced to labor. After several years, she ends up joining the Red Coast, a secret Chinese Radio wave laboratory. While working there, she uses the Sun as an amplifier and broadcasts a message to the universe. To her surprise, she receives a reply from an alien world called Trisolaris warning her not to reply or the Trisolarans will locate and invade Earth. Trisolaris is a planet in the Alpha Centauri system orbiting three Suns and their unpredictability leads the Trisolarans to search for a more hospitable world. Having lost her faith in mankind, she invites the Trisolarans and pledges to help them conquer Earth. Years later, a new cult of Trisolaran sympathizers is formed called Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO) who are aware of the incoming invasion and worship Trisolarans as saviors of the human race. They are in communication with Trisolaris and learn that they have departed Trisolaris and are headed for Earth and will arrive in 450 years. Afraid that during that time Earth's technology would evolve enough to defend against the invasion, the Trisolarans send a Sophon, a quantum supercomputer made from a single proton, to disrupt and put a stop to Earth's scientific progress. Around the same time, scientists around the world are committing suicide because physics somehow seems to be broken. Wang Miao, a nanotechnology researcher, seems to be the new target of the ETO and Trisolarans, and Miao along with a police officer named Shi Qiang and intelligence officers from around the world try to fight the battle with ETO to get information on the Trisolarans. After capturing the ETO and retrieving information, the last message that Trisolaris transmits to Earth is "You're bugs". Having lost hope in the future of humanity, Miao gains new hope thanks to Qiang and they begin preparing for the war against Trisolarans.

The first book spans generations and sets the stage for humanity's battle against the Trisolaran invaders. I was completely hooked by the story and it is one of the best science fiction books I have read, and having read the second book and in the middle of the third book, I can safely say that it is one of the best science fiction trilogies I have ever read. Netflix is planning a series based on the books with Game of Thrones showrunners and writers at the helm, and it has already gone through some intrigue of its own with one of the Chinese executive producers being poisoned recently in a suspected murder attempt.

## The Dark Forest

[![The Dark Forest](https://i.imgur.com/okCXu63.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Qt7YnxdQbs&rank=1)

The Dark Forest is the second book in the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy written by Cixin Liu but translated by Joel Martinsen this time around. While the first book spanned generations, this book spans centuries.

The book picks up roughly where the last one ended. After the discovery of the Trisolarans by the world and the invasion being 4 centuries away, the UN forms a Planetary Defense Council(PDC) to prepare for the incoming attack. However, the sophons are aware of everything humans are doing and has halted scientific progress. The only thing sophons can't do is read minds so the PDC comes up with a new initiative called the Wallfacer project. The idea is to select 4 people and grant them all of humanity's resources so they can each come up with a plan in secrecy without letting the sophons and Trisolorans know about it. The first three are selected based on experience but the last pick is a little known Chinese sociologist named Luo Ji. It is later revealed that the reason Luo Ji was chosen by the PDC is that they learned that Luo Ji was for whatever reason being targeted by the Trisolarans. The three Wallfacers begin creating a plan immediately using immense resources but Luo Ji uses his new status to retreat to an obscure place in Europe in a nice house with a romantic love interest. Luo Ji sees no point in trying to prepare for the fight as he sees no hope. After his wife and kids are taken away from him, he comes with an idea to broadcast a message to an unknown planet in the universe. He then goes into hibernation after a failed assassination attempt and wakes up 200 years later when humanity has successfully become interplanetary with thousands of starships ready for battle stationed around the Solar System. The UN is confident in its victory against the Trisolarans but after a single probe sent by the Trisolarans annihilates the entire Earth fleet, society back on Earth devolves into hysteria. Luo Ji is shunned and falls into alcoholism for not being able to come up with a plan to defend against the Trisolarans, but he gets news that the message he sent to the planet before his hibernation has been destroyed. Turns out his theory was true, and he uses that knowledge to threaten Trisolaris and create deterrence.

This book was a slow burn but when the action came, I was at the edge of my seat. The revelation at the end about what the Dark Forest theory meant and Luo Ji's standoff against the Trisolarans was a very satisfying end to the book. I liked the second book way more than the first one, and based on reviews I read of the third book The Death's End, the third book is the best in the trilogy and I can't wait to finish it.

## Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari

[![Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari](https://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9780062316110_p0_v5_s1200x630.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=1wGt0OpGCQ&rank=2)

Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari was one of the best books I read this year. Harari is a historian and a professor in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and also the writer of other bestsellers such as Homo Deus and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. The book chronicles how humans went from being an insignificant animal in the middle of the food chain to jumping our way to the top of the food chain, and how we went from using sticks and stones to building rockets and walking on the moon. The book is divided into four parts first of which is the cognitive revolution followed by the agricultural revolution, the unification of humankind, and the scientific revolution. It takes you through the three major revolutions in human history that brought us where we are today. Harari does a masterful job of conveying this information in a very beginner-friendly and digestible manner. It almost reads like a story, the story of humankind. This is a massive book and so dense in information that trying to condense the important points is a tough ask. I will attempt to write the main points from the first part but feel free to skip it. If you do find it interesting, I highly recommend reading the entire book.

### The Cognitive Revolution

Harari starts by giving us a very gentle introduction to biology. All organisms are classified into species, and animals belong to a particular species if they mate and give birth to fertile offsprings. These different species that evolved from a common ancestor fall under a 'genus'. For example, although a lion and a tiger descended from a common ancestor and fall under the genus Panthera, they are different species and have no desire to mate with each other, and if they are induced to mate, they will give birth to what is called ligers. However, these ligers are sterile which is why we don't see many inter-species offsprings.

You might be thinking, what about different breeds of dogs? Even though a German Shepherd may look different than a bulldog, they are of the same species and will successfully mate to produce hybrid offsprings that can go on to produce their offsprings. Centuries upon centuries of genetic selection, modification and interbreeding have led to hundreds of different breeds of dogs. Even though dogs descended from the gray wolf, most dog breeds look nothing like their ancestors.

_Dogs are example of genetically modified organisms_

Each organism is termed with a Latin name in the form of _genus species_. For example, Lions are called Panthera Leo, the species Leo of the genus Panthera. We, humans, are called Homo (man) sapiens (wise) or the wise man.

Although for the last 10,000 years our species has been the only living members of the genus homo, we had plenty of brothers and sisters that were different from us that roamed different parts of the world alongside us. A common misconception, that I subscribed to, is that we evolved linearly from one ancestor to another until we evolved into homo sapiens.

The fact is, based on the evidence, it's more like branches in a tree than a straight line. Several branches were moving forward at the same time and eventually, all of them perished making us the only surviving branch. Humans (the genus homo) evolved from a genus of apes called _Australopithecus_ about 2.5 million years ago in East Africa. These humans left Africa and ventured out into new lands in Europe and Asia and were shaped by their surroundings into distinct species. _Homo neanderthalensis_ (man from Neander Valley) evolved in Europe and Asia and their bulkier bodies were well suited to the cold climate. _Homo Erectus_ (Upright Man) evolved in East Asia and went on to become the longest surviving species of humans lasting 2 million years. In the Indonesian island of Java, _Homo soloensis_ (Man from the Solo Valley) evolved who were well suited to live in the tropics. _Homo floresiensis_ also evolved on another island called Flores in Indonesia, but due to lack of food and resources turned into dwarfs no higher than a meter. Another species was recently discovered in 2010 in the Denisova Cave in Siberia and was named _Homo denisova_. Simultaneously, a few more species evolved in East Africa namely _Homo rudolfensis_, _Homo ergaster_ and our species _Homo sapiens_.

The biggest factor that defined humans was our extraordinarily large brain size compared to other mammals. While mammals weighing around sixty kilograms have an average brain size of 200 cubic centimeters, we sapiens have almost seven times the brain mass averaging 1200-1400 cubic meters. Surprisingly, neanderthals had even larger brains. The question is, why did only humans evolve bigger brain size compared to other mammals of the same size? Every feature that humans possessed had its pros and cons. Although bigger brains allowed humans an edge that no other animal possessed, it had also one big drawback. The bigger the brain size, the more energy it consumes. Our brains are only 2-3 percent of our total body weight but it consumes a whopping 25 percent of our energy compared to 8 percent for apes. So it's completely justifiable that when you're writing a paper or working on a hard problem, you tend to feel just as if not more tired due to physical exertions. This meant that we had to spend more time searching for food and consuming food. Today we eat 500-600 more calories on average daily than chimps or orangutans. It also meant that since we were flexing our brain more, some of our muscles atrophied and we became weaker compared to other apes. If you listen to Joe Rogan, he will tell you just how much more ripped chimps are compared to humans and how easily they can rip us apart.

Another trait was our upright posture. It allowed humans a greater field of vision scanning for danger or food but we paid for it with backaches and stiff necks. Women's hips became narrower due to walking upright constricting the birth canal, especially when human heads were getting bigger, resulting in complications during birth and even death. Natural selection favored women who gave birth early when the size of the head was still small and over generations, humans started giving birth prematurely. This explains why every other animal can walk and run immediately after birth but human babies require years of caretaking until they are finally able to walk on their own.

One interesting fact that he brings up how our superior brains allowed us to quickly reach the top of the food chain, and how this had enormous consequences. Apex predators such as lions and sharks are the result of millions of years of evolution and the proper checks and balances evolved alongside them. Gazelles became faster to avoid being eaten by lions, hyenas started cooperating better, and so on. But humans climbed to the top so quickly that there hasn't been enough time for nature to develop proper checks and balances. Lions and sharks are confident in their position ruling over the animal kingdom but he compares humans to banana republic dictators. He claims that until recently we were in the middle of the food chain, and we are still full of fear and anxiety about our position that has resulted in deadly wars and calamities.

A significant stepping stone in the history of humans is the discovery and subsequent use of fire. Fire not only provided a source of warmth and light, but it also warded of dangerous predators. But the biggest change that fire brought was cooking. Previously indigestible foods such as wheat and rice became staples and it even killed deadly germs and parasites. It also significantly reduced eating time. While chimps spend about 5 hours a day chewing raw food, we can have a full Thanksgiving dinner in half an hour. It also made our teeth and jaws smaller.

When sapiens first arrived in Eurasia from Africa, the land was already inhabited by other species that we mentioned earlier. Since we are the only living species, what happened to them? According to Harari, there are two main theories. The "interbreeding theory" suggests that we mingled with each other and we are a result of this interbreeding. Europeans, therefore, are a mix of sapiens and neanderthals. Chinese and Koreans are a mix of sapiens of Erectus. The other theory is the "replacement theory" that suggests that we had little sexual interest and even if we did mate, we would produce infertile offsprings. The differences between the species would be too great and either they died off or we killed them and we are purely sapiens.

Recent findings indicate that 1-4 percent of human DNA of people from Europe and the Middle East is Neanderthal DNA and 6 percent of Denisovan DNA is present in Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians. Harari suggests that this could mean that both theories are somewhat correct and that if Neanderthals and other species survived, what would the world look like today?

In any case, our ability to communicate with each other was one of the remarkable feats of the cognitive revolution. All animals have some form of communication with each other but what separates us is how our language evolved as a way of gossiping. Humans are social animals and we need to know who hates who in a group, who is sleeping with who, who did what embarrassing things and the list goes on. This gossip theory seemed like a joke at first when I was reading it but when I think about it, it kinda makes sense. Think back to middle school or high school. We all remember being part of gossips and wanting to be involved in it. We are so used to it, that Harari suggests our language evolved for this very purpose. It also reminded me of an episode of the Office where Michael Scott feels left out and desperately wants to be part of a gossip. After he finally hears gossip that could put an employee in a tough spot, he goes around telling completely made-up gossip of almost everyone and by the end of the episode, all the employees can talk about is the gossip that they heard about themselves and others. But I digress. The truly unique thing about our language, according to Harari is not even the ability to transmit information about our colleagues in the office or to warn about lions or tigers, it's our ability to transmit information about things that don't even exist.

There are a few concepts that I found mind-blowing in this book and this is one of them. Monkeys can warn against predators by making a sound that warns "Careful! A lion!" but only humans can say "The lion is the guardian spirit of our tribe." Everything from religion to myths to gods can be attributed to the fact that we can think of abstract things. Harari gives a great example of how you could never convince a monkey to give you a banana in his hand by promising him limitless banana in monkey heaven. But isn't fiction also dangerous and it could lead us to spend more time worshipping the lion guardian than on our survival? Harari claims that myths and fiction allowed us, humans, to become a collective group.

A band of chimps can only be so large because each chimp can only know a handful of other chimps. The alpha male needs to lead this coalition and there are clear limits on how large this group can be. Two chimps from different groups who have never groomed each other before can never trust one another. On the other hand, gossip allowed Sapiens to form larger groups. He points out that even gossip has its limits. Research shows that the maximum size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. How did Sapiens manage to cross this threshold and build civilizations and empires and nations consisting of millions of individuals? He claims that it had something to do with the invention of fiction. Two Catholics who have never met before can go on crusades because they both believe in the Christian God. Similarly, states and nations are a myth too. Two people from a nation who have never met might be willing to risk their lives for their country. He even goes as far as to say that gods, nations, money, human rights, laws, and justice doesn't exist outside of the human imagination. The next example he gives of the automobile company Peugeot drives his point home.

He asks the reader if companies like Peugeot exist? The Peugeot vehicles that exist on the road are not the company because even if all the cars were totaled, the company would not disappear because it could manufacture new cars. Then do all the employees and factories and mechanics comprise the company? Even if a natural disaster were to kill them all, Peugeot could hire new employees and build new factories. It seems like these companies are invulnerable and they don't physically exist. However, if a judge were to mandate the dissolution of the company, its employees and factories would continue to exist but Peugeot would cease to exist. Harari calls Peugeot a figment of our collective imagination. Limited liability companies such as Peugeot are what lawyers call a "legal fiction". It only exists as a legal entity. In the past before liability companies, if someone set up a business, the individual would be the business. If the person sold carts, and it broke down, a customer could sue the individual personally. If the business failed, the person would have to pay the debts, and if they couldn't, they could be sent to jail. The person who starts a business would be fully liable. As you can imagine, this would discourage entrepreneurship and this was a major problem for businesses back in the day. So people started collectively imagining the existence of limited liability companies. If you set up an LLC, it is legally independent of you. Armand Peugeot, the founder of Peugeot, after he set up his limited liability company was completely free from liability. If a customer buys his car and it doesn't work, he can sue Peugeot but not him. Even if the company went bankrupt and owed a huge debt, Armand himself did not owe his creditors after all the debt was owed by the company. Even after the death of Armand, the company still exists.

The book is filled with interesting and mind-boggling revelations such as these. In the Agricultural Revolution part, Harari claims that Agriculture was "history's biggest fraud" or as Donald Trump would say "the worst trade deal in history." He claims that we humans didn't domesticate wheat but vice versa is true. Since the agricultural revolution, wheat spread throughout Earth and we worked harder and longer in return for a worse diet compared to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Instead of traveling, we permanently settled around our wheat fields to take care of it. In part four, he claims that Money is one of the best myths that we humans have invented. No matter where we're from or what we believe in, we all believe in this paper that doesn't have any innate value other than the one we believe it to have. This was also the period when religion began to strengthen.
