What is the nature of reality? How did things come into existence? What is our place in the universe? What are morality and virtue? How to live a good life? These are some of the questions ancient Greeks found themselves pondering. These thinkers were called philosophers derived from Greek Philo (to love) and Sophia (wisdom) meaning to love wisdom.

To someone who has never read philosophy, the ideas of these ancient philosophers might seem a little crude or even plain dumb sometimes. But we have to understand that these guys had no reference or pre-written material that they could build their ideas upon, and the language that they used to express these ideas was itself very crude. Some of them even claimed that they got their ideas from a god or goddess. These guys were mostly pioneers. Before them, everyone accepted that the universe and everything in it was the result of a god, or gods in the case of the Greeks and that things happened due to divine intervention. It is scary to not know how we came into being and how insignificant we are. This human condition is why almost every human culture that ever existed invented stories about gods and divine intervention as a way of bringing order to the chaos and to remind ourselves of our importance.

Today, when we think of geniuses we instantly think of Albert Einstein. His name has become synonymous with genius, and rightfully so. But even though his theory of special and general relativity was novel, he still had centuries upon centuries of math and physics to build upon. Isaac Newton once wrote in a letter to Robert Hooke his famous statement that "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulder of Giants." What he meant was the only reason he could come up with his laws of gravitation and motion was because he had works of Kepler and Galileo to build upon. But anyway, it is fascinating to read what these early philosophers came up with and how their ideas evolved and matured and spanned more topics starting from metaphysics, which deals with how things came into being, to topics like epistemology, which is about how we know things, ethics, logic, and social and political topics. We can even thank these philosophers for modern science, democracy, and the notion of justice.

When I took Philosophy in my freshman year in college, I had very little opinion of it going in. I didn't care for it and I only saw it as a checklist towards my degree. To my surprise, I ended up really enjoying that class thanks to the professor. His name was Doug Howie and he was a brilliant and funny guy whose love for philosophy rubbed on to me and no doubt to other students. We didn't get to cover many philosophers in that class but I vowed to go through all the philosophers myself. The more I read philosophy, the more I realize that every self-help book ever written is simply a rehashing of the teachings of these philosophers just in a modern package that is relatable to us.

Unfortunately, I didn't get back into philosophy until a few months ago when I was looking for a new educational podcast and I stumbled upon [Philosophize This](https://www.philosophizethis.org/) hosted by Stephen West. He does an amazing job of talking about philosophers from the West and East and their teachings in a chronological manner. I fell in love with the show and I highly recommend it. It also made me want to get back into philosophy. To quote from his website "Philosophy has given me a tremendous gift. It has humbled me. It has made me a more open and loving person. It has made me a better listener. I couldn’t tell you whether philosophy will have practical benefits in your life or not. I don’t think philosophy is a panacea for the world’s problems by any means. But I do think it can be extremely helpful for the right kind of person." I think this is amazing and I wish to be more humble, open, and loving. I am not entirely looking to philosophy as a source for these things but simply as one source among many that can provide guidance, wisdom, and happiness in my life. I wish to become wiser and be an audience member in "The Great Conversation" that has spanned thousands of years. I am not trying to be a philosopher either, and I believe I will not be able to contribute any new ideas or thoughts into the discussion but simply write about them. I will be mainly using the podcast, the works of the philosophers, and the book _The Great Conversation_ by Norman Melchert as references for my posts on philosophy. By the way, I think that's a very apt title for a book on philosophy.

## The Gods of Homer and Hesiod

To embark on this philosophical journey through time, we must start first with the writings of Homer and Hesiod. Hesiod was a poet who in the mid 8th century BC wrote the poem _Theogony_ about the origins of the gods and the war among them. The condensed version is that Earth (Gaia) and Heaven (Ouranos) gave birth to the three races of gods: the Titans, the Cyclops, and three mighty and violent sons. Kronos, the boldest of the Titans, along with his mother plots vengeance against Earth. Kronos becomes the ruler of Titans and has three children with Rhea but upon learning of a prophecy that one of his children will dethrone him, swallows them all. Rhea bears another child, hiding it from Kronos. This child is Zeus. After he grows and gains full strength, he persuades Kronos to drink a potion which makes him vomit the three children. Zeus along with his brothers claim war on the Titans and free the Cyclops from Tartarus who then give Zeus a lightning bolt, Poseidon a Trident, and Hades a helmet that makes him invisible. With this, they overthrow the titans and divide the territory with Zeus ruling over the sky, Poseidon ruling over the sea, and Hades ruling in Tartarus.

Homer was also a poet who wrote the famous poems _The Illiad_ and _The Odyssey_. In _The Illiad_, he writes about the [Trojan war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War) in the context of the Greek gods. These texts were back in the day like the Bible or the Quran today and the Greeks looked to these tales for signs of divine intervention and to discover excellence in all manner of things including human life.

## The Pre-Socratics

These are the philosophers that lived before or around Socrates. Around this time (~600 BC), these thinkers started to become unsatisfied by the explanations given by myths found in the writings of _Homer_ and _Hesiod_ about the nature of the world. They're considered natural philosophers because they mostly dealt with the topic of metaphysics. There is not much that we know about them and most of what we know about them is from the writing of other philosophers, mainly Plato and Aristotle. Here's a graph of these thinkers and what school of thought they belonged to:

Most of these pre-socratic philosophers were from Ionia, the region west of present-day Turkey. Here is a map of ancient greece with Ionia to the East.

### Thales

![Thales](https://i.imgur.com/oqLO3L4.jpg)

Thales (circa 625-547 B.C.) from Miletus was considered the founder of philosophy by Aristotle. There is not much we know about him but we know that he was interested in the origins and his answer to the question of reality was that water was the main cause and element of all things and that all things are filled with gods. That is very obscure. Was he alluding to the fact that life was born on water and that there is no life without water? Probably not, as their understanding of the origin of life was not as advanced as ours. It is interesting to see similarities between the thoughts of these ancient natural philosophers and our modern understanding of the universe. What about the second part? All things are filled with gods. The thing about Greek gods was that they were immortal, and Thales might be suggesting that things contain a principle that is immortal in them and we don't have to look at outside or divince causes for their behavior. In this way, he seeked explanation for why things exists in our world instead of looking at another world or the realm of gods.

### Anaximander

![Anaximander](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Anaximander_Mosaic_%28cropped,_with_sundial%29.jpg)

Anaximander, born around 612 B.C. in Miletus, was another one of these early thinkers who wanted to answer the origin question. He, like Thales, was more interested in natural explanation instead of the Godly reasons presented by _Homer_ and _Hesiod_. His answer to the question is one of the infinite or the boundless. He reasons that we can trace the state of anything back to its beginnings or origins and that there was a prior state and that prior state had a beginning and an origin as well and we can keep on going back and go all the way back to a state which has no beginning from which everything results. Modern comparisons can be drawn to the big bang theory. This thing that has no beginning is the boundless and it had no beginning, it _is_ the beginning and since it is infinite, it has no end either meaning it's immortal like the Greek gods. The boundless also contains everything in it in a "chaotic" mixture. But if everything is in a mixture, how does the boundless differentiate between different things such as hot or cold, wet or dry. How does _many_ result from this _one_. Anaximander uses an analogy of a circular pan with water with different bits of metals of different weights mixed together. When it is swirled together, it is in a _chaotic_ mixture but once it settles, the heavier bits move towards the middle while the heavier bits move towards the outside. Things get separated based on their nature and order is formed. But why is the boundless engaged in this vortex motion? He gives the example of the sky where stars and planets are always in a swirling motion around the earth.

### Xenophanes:

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/SfajDVY.jpg)

While Anaximander's criticism of the Greek myths was implicit, Xenophanes's criticism was more explicit. Xenophanes was a poet who lived in Colophon (south of Miletus) and fled to Sicily when the Persians took over. His criticisms of the gods are based on two grounds.

> Homer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods all those things which
> in men are a matter of reproach and censure: stealing, adultery, and
> mutual deception.

He seems to criticize the Homer and Hesiod gods as being no morally better than mere mortals, and that to portray the gods having human characteristics is _shameful_. This means that Homer's portrayal of gods is not a reflection of truth but a fiction.

> The Ethiopians make their gods snub-nosed and black; the Thracians
> make theirs gray-eyed and red-haired.

Here, he's pointing out the fact that gods are portrayed differently throughout human culture and that they tend to mirror the characteristics of their culture.

> And if oxen and horses and lions had hands, and could draw with their
> hands and do what man can do, horses would draw the gods in the shape
> of horses, and oxen in the shape of oxen, each giving the gods bodies
> similar to their own.

This is considered to be the first writing in history suggesting that we make gods in our image and not the other way around. According to Xenophanes, this is what Homer and Hesiod did and he is not satisfied with their interpretation of gods. Any natural phenomena, especially unexplained phenomena such as rainbows, ligthnings and storms, were all attributed to gods. Xenophanes tosses this away and says that they can be explained and that they are simply natural phenomena.

So, is Xenophanes simply an atheist who doesn't believe in god? On the contrary. Xenophanes says "one god, greatest among gods and men, in no way similar to mortals either in body or mind." He does believe in _one_ god that is very different from the Homeric gods.

### Heraclitus

![Heraclitus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/Heraklit.jpg)
_Credits: Wikipedia_

Heraclitus of Ephesus is most known for being obscure and writing in short, pithy riddles. Not much remains of his work but about 100 fragments from a book he wrote. His defining thought is that reality and everything in it is in constant flux. "All things come into being through opposition, and all are in flux, like a river." There are two things to unpack here: the opposition and the flux. The idea of opposition in nature can be explained by an example of a river. A river only exists due to the banks opposing the flowing force of the river. Similarly, a guitar produces music because there is tension in the strings, and someone playing it has to pull it in one direction, and the strings pull it in the opposite direction. Newton's third law of motion: every force has an equal and opposite force. To apply it to society, Heraclitus asks, if justice is not the result of the conflict.

> Upon those who step into the same rivers flow other and yet other waters.

What he means is that you can step into the same river twice but it will not be the same river because the water is different. Plato described it a little differently and more famously as "you cannot step twice into the same river." ascribing it to Heraclitus. Heraclitus thinks that there is this oneness in things that are different or opposites.

> Sea water is very pure and very impure; drinkable and healthful for fishes, but undrinkable and destructive to men.

The sea water is the "same" and it contains both purity and impurity in it.

### Parmenides

![Parmenides](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Parmenides.jpg)

Parmenides had a completely different idea from the other natural philosophers so far, and one that is a little difficult to understand. He wrote a poem in which he claimed that the revelation in it was revealed to him by a goddess when he was driven by a horse into heaven and the presence of this goddess.

"Welcome, youth, who come attended by immortal charioteers and mares which bear you on your journey to our dwelling. For it is no evil fate that has set you to travel on this road, far from the beaten paths of men, but right and justice. It is meet that you learn all things — both the unshakable heart of well-rounded truth and the opinions of mortals in which there is not true belief."

The goddess told him to "judge by reasoning the much-contested argument that I have spoken." He is inviting us to judge "by reasoning" the claim in his poem. His main argument was that what is _is_ and what is not _is not_ and that thinking and thought are the same and that thought and being are the same. When you think of something, you think of what _is_. Let's say you think that you're sitting in a chair. The chair exists so you're thinking of something that _is_. What about something fictional? What if you think of a magic flying carpet like in Aladdin? That obviously doesn't exist so you're thinking of what _is not_ and not what _is_. Well, Parmenides would say that a carpet exists and birds do fly so flying and carpet both _are_. Basically, he's saying that we can't think of something that doesn't exist or is _not_ and that thought and "being" are the same. This also reminds me of a [standup bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR8Um_vZ3oM&ab_channel=kickapig10) by Louis C.K. where he's talking about how his daughter doesn't accept any answer and keeps asking "why" until it gets to the point where he's saying abstract stuff like "well some things are and some things are not. 'Why?' Because things that are not can't be." From this line of thought, he concludes that the ideas about the many are false. We think that there are many things. I'm sitting on a chair and there's a table in front of me and those are two things. But according to Parmenides, there is no distinction between a table and a chair. They're one and the same. This is the exact opposite of Heraclitus's beliefs that everything is always changing. We are born and then we die. Parmenides, however, tells us that the idea that "we came into being" means that we formerly _were not_ and since we cannot even think of something that _is not_ as it implies "not being" for thinking and being are the same thing. Similarly, when we die, there is no "realm of not being".

> How could what is perish? How could it have come to be? For if it came into being, it is not; nor is it if ever it is going to be. Thus coming into being is extinguished, and destruction unknown.

From this, he claims that there is no such thing as coming into being and passing away and there is no flux. The notion of change or motion is merely an illusion. Parmenides thought of the universe as one eternal, unchanging sphere that always existed. This extreme idea of only one is called monism. This is hard to believe and seems like common sense to us because we see with our eyes the many things in nature, people being born and passing away, and things moving all the time but Parmenides urges us to not rely on our sensory experiences but to rely on reason. One of his pupils, Zeno, claims that commonsense has a lot of contradictions and his main problem is with motion. He gives us three arguments, one of which is that suppose you're in your chair and you want to go to the bathroom. To get to the bathroom, you would have to first get to the midpoint between the chair and the bathroom, and to get to that midpoint, you would have to get to the midpoint between your chair and the midpoint and on and on meaning you would never be able to get out of your chair.

The notion of using reason instead of our senses, which could be misleading, is why Parmenides is considered a rationalist. He established precedence to follow reason that would affect Western philosophy and science for millennia to come.

### Democritus

![Democritus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Democritus2.jpg)

Democritus is one of the important figures in developing the "atomist" thought along with Lecippus. Atom is derived from the Greek _atomon_ which means uncuttable and it was meant to reconcile Parmenides thought of "the one" with "the many". What Democritus thought was that everything is made up of these uncuttable atoms and that it's moving around in "the void". Although it served as a precursor for modern atomic theory, the atoms of Democritus were different in the sense that they had different shapes, arrangements and position. These atoms hook together in different ways to form things that we see or experience. The atomists also explain being born and passing away as atoms hooking together in appropriate ways to form a person and dispersing or getting loose when someone passes away.

He also wrote about how to live a good life. Here are some of his writings on the topic:

> Medicine cures the diseases of the body; wisdom, on the other hand,
> relieves the sould of its sufferings.
>
> Moderation increases enjoyment, and makes pleasure even greater.
>
> The good things of life are produced by learning with hard work; the
> bad are reaped of their own accord, without hard work.

Next time, we will be looking at the Sophists who were masters of rhetoric and Socrates, who is one of the most influential figures in philosophy.
