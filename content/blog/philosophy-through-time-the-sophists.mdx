Before we start talking about the Sophists, it's best to give a little background on the state of Greece during this time period. Around 500 B.C., Greece was not a unified state but rather a bunch of city-states with their own natural borders and citizens. The most prominent city-states among them were Sparta and Athens, and most of these city-states were involved in rivalries and wars. When we talked about the pre-socratics, some of the foremost philosophers came from different city-states and contributed to philosophy. Around 400 B.C., however, things started to shift and the Greek culture became more centralized and focused on one city-state: Athens. There are two main reasons for this shift. The first is democracy and the second is the Persian wars.

## Democracy in Athens

Solon was an Athenian lawmaker who lived around 500 B.C. and he is credited with laying the groundwork for Athenian democracy. Before his reforms, the state was administered by aristocrats appointed based on nobility or wealth, and commonfolk had little to no saying in matters of court or legislation. Solon's constitution gave voice to the Assembly comprised of all free men. Although the Council (aristocrats) still made important decisions, the Assembly could take part in government and veto wildly unpopular legislation. A prime example of this is when in 508 B.C. there was a large influx of immigrants to Athens from neighboring city-states. Athens was enjoying a golden age and it's only natural that people from other city-states flocked to Athens. The issue was of extending citizenship to the immigrants proposed by the Assembly and this resulted in a quarrel between the aristocrats and the Assembly. Aristocrats opposed citizenship fearful for their position of power but caved after the people sieged the Acropolis (a Greek citadel) for three days. Thus, citizenship was granted to the new immigrants, albeit not for women and slaves, and henceforth the Assembly took control of major decisions. Athenian democracy is considered to be the first known democracy in the world. Other city-states soon followed suit and implemented democracies following the Athenian model.

## The Persian War

The Greek cities on the shores of Asia Minor were of natural interest to whatever dominant power at that time, the Persians in this case, due to their geographical location. These cities paid taxes to Persians but in 499 B.C. they rebelled and with the aid of Athens, burnt Sardis, a major Persian city, to the ground. The rebellion was ultimately put to stop by the Persians and unrest followed the Greek mainland because Persians now had reason to take revenge and Athens had played a major role. The Persians did strike back in 490 B.C. but were defeated by the Greeks led by an Ionian general Miltiades. This victory was met with great excitement by the Greeks but they knew it would be short-lived as the Persians wouldn't give up so easily. There were two main defense strategies they came up with. One was to defend on land like they did in their earlier victory and the other was to build more ships and defend on the sea. After much debate and infighting, they decided to go with the latter strategy. The king of the Persians, Xerxes, advanced with around 200,000 soldiers towards Athens after defeating Thrace. The Greeks sought advice from the Oracle at Delphi, who was a priestess in the Temple of Delphi who made prophecies under divine possession by the god Apollo. Her response was:

> That the wooden wall only shall not fall, but help you and your children.

People argued what this meant with Themistocles arguing that the "wooden wall" referred to the ships. Most people, but not all, followed Themistocles to sea. The march of Persians towards Athens was seen as a threat to entire Greece, not just Athens. A small army of Spartans led by the Sparta king Leonidas went to battle with the Persians at Thermopylae, outside of Athens. Heavily outnumbered, the Spartans put up a good fight but were ultimately defeated by the Persian army. The comic book and movie _300_ are based on these events, although the story is considered a historical fantasy. The Persians eventually overtook Athens but the Athenian army, who were at sea, completely demolished Xerxes navy. The strategy seemed to have worked and the combined forces of Athens and Sparta defeated the Persians and expelled them.

What followed the war was a major change in the Greek lifestyle. Athens having displayed great power and successfully defended the city, became the leader in Greek defense which empowered their sea forces and quickly turned them into an empire. Other city-states now looked to Athens for protection. Athens became very wealthy too with control of the sea and flourishing trade. Under Pericles, who was the most influential democratic leader, Athens became the cultural center for Greece and enjoyed a prosperous Golden Age.

## The Sophists

Around the fifth century B.C., education took center stage in Athens. The traditional ways of educating oneself in the works of Homer and Hesiod were no longer enough and to become successful in the city, more was required. Athens also had a great legal and court system where you had to present your case or defend yourself and a lot of Athenians participated in it. Whether or not you were convicted depended much on how well you could persuade the court about your innocence, even if you were guilty. There was also a rising middle class and they wanted their sons and daughters to become educated. To fill the need for this "higher" education, a new class of educators arose who called themselves Sophists. "Sophist" derives from the Greek word _Sophos_, which means wise. They charged money for their instructions, they moved from city to city and taught people all manner of things such as astronomy, geometry, and even music but their main focus was on improving one's personal and political standing in society and defending themselves in court through the art of rhetoric. The most successful Sophists became very wealthy. In that sense, these guys were like modern-day lawyers but instead of them defending you in court, they taught you how to defend yourself.

### Rhetoric

Athenians loved their judicial system and people would be brought to court to defend themselves for all kinds of things. A persuasive argument would help sway the sentiment of the court even if you were guilty. On the other hand, a poor and incoherent argument would make you lose the case even if you were innocent. Furthermore, if you were to make your opinion on an issue heard, you had to be very good at persuasive speaking. Only people with good public speaking skills could turn the heads of the Assembly. This meant people needed to be good at the art of rhetoric. This is exactly what the Sophists taught and were famous for. Plato wrote about one prominent Sophist, Gorgias in one of his dialogues as teaching

> the power to convince by our words the judges in court, the senators in Council, the people in the Assembly, or in any other gathering of a citizen body.

> The rhetorician is competent to speak against anybody on any subject, and to prove himself more convincing before a crowd on practically every topic he wishes.

It is clear that the Sophists considered rhetoric a very important skill and art and they were masters of it. But to the Sophists, it was more about being able to produce good arguments and persuasively speak on both sides of an issue. Imagine you were in a debate tournament but instead of debating with someone else, you had to debate against yourself and the only way you could win was to make equally persuasive arguments on both sides of a topic.

There's a funny story of Protagoras, one of the most influential Sophists, and his student where he instructs a student on how to win in courts. However, since the student was poor Protagoras agrees that he wouldn't have to pay until he won his first case. Some time passes and the student still hasn't entered in courts so Protagoras himself takes him to court on accounts of not paying him. The student makes the case that if he wins, he does not have to pay Protagoras by the judgment of the court. And if he loses, he still would not have to pay because he would not have won his first case yet. Protagoras, not to be outsmarted by his own student, makes the case that if the student loses, he would have to pay him by the judgment of the court, and if the student wins, he would have to pay Protagoras because he won his first case.

This story is considered apocryphal but what's more important to note is that if
Sophists believe that an argument could be made for and against anything, do they
believe in objective truth, or is truth purely subjective to them? Can one differentiate
between truth and opinion? To the Sophists, there is no difference. We are confined
to the way we see reality and we can't see beyond it. Many of the early natural Philosophers
used to think that we are "cut off" from reality and that our human senses cannot
discern reality. They realized how deceiving our senses are and that their unreliability
caused us to have a distorted view. One of the most famous ideas was proposed by
Plato with his world of forms theory which suggested that what we see in the physical
world is merely an imperfect copy and its true essence lies in the world of forms
that human beings can never perceive.

Most of us are pretty confident in the ability of our senses. We think that what we see, hear or smell is a pretty accurate representation of the "real" world. Democritus thought that we are confined to sense experience but intelligence can free us our reliance on the senses and help us see and know what our eyes won't - that everything is made up of atoms and void. Due to their practice of rhetoric, Sophists did believe that we were tied to appearance but that we could not reason our way to truth as one could reason equally well that the world was made of atoms or not. They were skeptical of the idea that humans can arrive at the truth at all. Rhetoric allowed them to make a case for or against anything. This simply meant that instead of trying to lift the veil off reality, they were content with the world of appearances as they could explain it very well.

### Relativism

According to Oxford Dictionary, Relativism is "the doctrine that knowledge, truth, and morality exist in relation to culture, society, or historical context, and are not absolute". This is best encapsulated by Protagoras in his now-famous statement from the book _On Truth_ where he claims

> Of all things the measure is man.

This is also framed as "Man is the measure of all things." As we've seen of the Sophists, they believe that real truth cannot be attained and that it is purely subjective. If something is true to me, then it must be true but if the same thing is false for someone else, then for that person, it is false. We are the sole authority on whether something is true or not and each person "measures" it for themselves. How can something be true and false at the same time? Let's take an example of a thermostat in an apartment. Two people living together might come to different conclusions about whether it is hot or cold and whether to turn up the thermostat or to turn it down. I believe people who have lived with roommates have undoubtedly faced such a situation before. Who is more right in this situation? The Sophists would argue that they are both right and the temperature is indeed too hot and too cold.

What are the implications of this? One implication of this is that truth is derived from the best opinion or the one that does the best job of convincing. This opinion could differ from culture to culture, from time to time, even individual to individual but whichever opinion does the best job of convincing the most number of people prevails. We can observe this in modern politics where whichever side of an issue resonates more with the most number of people will likely gather traction and eventually be passed as law. Unsurprisingly, future generations might see the flaws in the stance taken by the previous generation and amend the law to fit more with the evolving times. .
